## I. Definition

### Project Overview
The purpose of the data engineering capstone project is to give a chance to combine what you've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve your data engineering-related career goals.

In this project, you can choose to complete the project provided for you, or define the scope and data for a project of your own design. Either way, you'll be expected to go through the same steps outlined below.

 2. Go to the Amazon EC2 console
 3. In the Navigation pane, click Key Pairs
 4. On the Key Pairs page, click Create Key Pair
 5. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a name for your key pair, such as, mykeypair
 6. Make sure that you select ppk under File format
 7. Click Create
 8. Save the resulting PEM file in a safe location

#### Update eks-cluster-sg-udacityDataEng1-349815526 security group to accept SSH:
 1. Go to EC2

 8. Click edit Edit inbound rules
 9. Click Add rule
 10. From the first(Type) Drop-down select SSH
 11. From the next drop-down(source) select my IP
 12. Click Save rules

#### Set up the infrastructure
##### Setup Redshift
1. Download [Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project-Redshift.yaml](https://github.com/sahussain/Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Infrastructure/Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project-Redshift.yaml "Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project-Redshift.yaml")
2. Go to AWS Cloud Formation page
3. Click Create stack
4. Click upload file and choose [Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project-Redshift.yaml](https://github.com/sahussain/Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Infrastructure/Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project-Redshift.yaml "Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project-Redshift.yaml")
5. Fill in the `Parameters` and click `Next`
6. Don't fill any thing on `Configure stack options` and Click `Next`
7. On Review page click `Create stack`

##### Setup Airflow
1. Go to [Turbine git repo](https://github.com/villasv/aws-airflow-stack)
2. Scroll down until you see 'Deploy the stack` and click Launch stack
3. On the Create stack page click `Next`
4. Name your stack airflow and click `Next`. You don't need to change anything on this page
5. Don't fill any thing on `Configure stack options` and Click `Next`
6. On Review page Scroll down to `Capabilities` and check both
